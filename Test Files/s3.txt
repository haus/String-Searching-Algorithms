If liberalism still meant what it meant to an English historian who in 
1827 could speak of the revolution of 1688 as "the triumph of those 
principles which in the language of the present day are denominated 
liberal or constitutional" or if one could still, with Lord Acton, 
speak of Burke, Macaulay, and Gladstone as the three greatest liberals, 
or if one could still, with Harold Laske, regard Tocqueville and Lord 
Acton as "the essential liberals of the nineteenth century," I should 
indeed be only too proud to describe myself by that name. But, much as 
I am tempted to call their liberalism true liberalism, I must recognize 
that the majority of Continental liberals stood for ideas to which 
these men were strongly opposed, and that they were led more by a 
desire to impose upon the world a preconceived rational pattern than to 
provide opportunity for free growth. The same is largely true of what 
has called itself Liberalism in England at least since the time of 
Lloyd George.
